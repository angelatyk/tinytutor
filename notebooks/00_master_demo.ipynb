        "Generate runnable Python code that serves as the final, end-to-end showcase for the **TinyTutor** educational system. This notebook must simulate importing and executing the fully integrated multi-agent system (`TutoringPipeline`) as defined in the modular backend structure (backend/app/pipelines/tutoring_pipeline.py). The demonstration must prove that the entire agentic architecture—including reasoning, tool use, memory influence, and evaluation—is functional.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Environment Setup:** Include standard imports (ADK, Gemini) and boilerplate for environment configuration.\n",
        "2.  **Simulated Import:** Write code to simulate the import of the final `TutoringPipeline` class, which orchestrates all sub-agents (Pedagogy, Scriptwriting, Media, Safety/Evaluator).\n",
        "3.  **Execution Query:** Execute the pipeline using an input query (e.g., \"Explain how Photosynthesis works like I am 5\"). The query must be designed to test all major components, including memory integration.\n",
        "4.  **Memory Demonstration:** The execution must simulate the system successfully retrieving and applying a **previously stored personalization preference** (e.g., character theme like \"pirates\" or \"dinosaurs\" saved in Notebook 4), ensuring the `ScriptwritingAgent`'s output is customized.\n",
        "5.  **Multimodal Output Synthesis (Action/Tool Use):** The final system response must synthesize the structured results from the `MediaAgent` (Notebooks 2 & 3), clearly displaying the references (URIs/paths) for:\n",

        "    *   Simulated Audio URI (TTS Tool Use)\n",
        "    *   Simulated Video/Image Storyboard URI (Image Tool Use)\n",
        "6.  **Evaluation Visibility (Agent Ops):** The final output block must clearly present the quality assessment metrics or the pass/fail status returned by the **Evaluator Agent (LLM-as-a-Judge)** (Notebook 5), ensuring the quality check is demonstrated as part of the pipeline result.\n",
        "7.  **Final Value Articulation:** The output must clearly articulate the full, aggregated multimodal result to satisfy the demo requirements for the capstone project.\n",

        "## Generation Prompt\n",
        "\"Generate the runnable Python code for the '00_master_demo.ipynb' notebook for the **TinyTutor** project. The code must simulate importing and running the complete `TutoringPipeline`. The demonstration must execute a single query that confirms: **multi-agent orchestration**, **tool usage (audio/video URIs)**, **memory retrieval (e.g., using a 'robot' theme)**, and the final **evaluation score/status** from the judge agent. Focus the code on execution and result display, reflecting the integrated system.\""
