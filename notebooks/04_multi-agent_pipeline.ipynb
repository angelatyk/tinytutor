        "# TinyTutor Capstone Notebook 4: Multi-Agent Pipeline with Memory Integration\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "Generate runnable Python code using the **ADK** to implement the complete, orchestrated **TinyTutor** multi-agent pipeline using the Coordinator Pattern. This notebook must integrate persistence by demonstrating how **Memory** and **Context Engineering** enable personalization across separate conversational turns. This establishes the foundation for a Level 3 Collaborative Multi-Agent System.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Agent and Tool Definitions:** Re-define the core agents (`PedagogyAgent`, `ScriptwritingAgent` from NB 1) and the custom tools (`generate_tts_audio`, `generate_video_storyboard` from NB 2/3).\n",
        "2.  **Specialized Media Agent:** Define a new `LlmAgent` named `MediaAgent`.\n",
        "    *   **Role:** This specialist is dedicated solely to multimodal output generation. Equip it with the audio and video `FunctionTool`s. Its instruction should guide it to consume the `{final_script}` and call both tools simultaneously or sequentially.\n",
        "3.  **Memory Service Setup:** Instantiate and configure an ADK **`InMemoryMemoryService`** and an **`InMemorySessionService`**. Provide both services to the `Runner` instance to enable state management and long-term storage.\n",
        "4.  **Personalization Tool (Storage):** Define a custom `FunctionTool`, `save_preference_tool(theme: str)`, whose associated Python function explicitly uses the `ToolContext` to interact with the `memory_service` and store a user's style preference (e.g., \"Use a specific character theme\").\n",
        "5.  **Coordinator Agent (`TinyTutorCoordinator`):** Define a high-level `LlmAgent` that acts as the traffic manager.\n",
        "    *   **Orchestration:** Its instructions must enforce the sequential flow: (1) Pedagogy → (2) Scriptwriting → (3) Media Generation. Demonstrate **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** delegation by wrapping the sub-agents using **`AgentTool`**.\n",
        "    *   **Tools:** The coordinator must be equipped with the custom `save_preference_tool` for preference recording.\n",
        "6.  **Context Engineering (Retrieval):** Implement a method for the **`ScriptwritingAgent`** to retrieve and utilize the stored preference. Use either the built-in **`PreloadMemoryTool`** (proactive retrieval) or a **custom callback**  to inject the retrieved memory (e.g., \"User prefers pirate characters\") directly into the agent's prompt instructions before it generates the story script.\n",
        "7.  **Execution (Two-Turn Demonstration):**\n",
        "    *   **Turn 1 (Storage):** Run the `TinyTutorCoordinator` with a prompt that triggers the `save_preference_tool` (e.g., \"I only want lessons using robots as characters from now on.\").\n",
        "    *   **Turn 2 (Retrieval & Use):** Execute a **new session** (different Session ID) with a new topic (e.g., \"Explain the Water Cycle\"). The system must retrieve the stored \"robot\" preference and successfully incorporate that theme into the final generated script, proving persistence and Context Engineering functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generation Prompt\n",
        "\"Generate the runnable Python code for the '04_multi_agent_pipeline.ipynb' notebook for the **TinyTutor** project. The code must implement the full multi-agent orchestration using `AgentTool`s (A2A simulation) and fully integrate ADK's `InMemoryMemoryService`. The solution must include a two-turn demonstration: Turn 1 saves a user preference ('robot theme') using a custom tool, and Turn 2, executed in a new session, successfully retrieves this memory using **proactive retrieval** to customize the story script for the topic 'The Water Cycle.'\""
