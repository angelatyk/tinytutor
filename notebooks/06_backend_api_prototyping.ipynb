        "## Objective\n",
        "Generate runnable Python code to simulate the final architecture for production deployment to **Vertex AI Agent Engine**. This notebook must demonstrate two critical production concepts: 1) Packaging the final, modular agent system into a deployable backend structure, and 2) Implementing **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication** where specialized agents delegate tasks to each other across simulated service boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Include standard ADK and Gemini imports and authentication boilerplate (simulating GCP Project ID/Location configuration).\n",
        "2.  **A2A Simulation:** Define a simplified, two-agent system to demonstrate A2A delegation:\n",
        "    *   **`ReviewerAgent`:** A specialized agent (simulating `backend/app/agents/reviewer_agent.py`) focused solely on quality checking, equipped with minimal tools (none needed for simulation, focus on instructions).\n",
        "    *   **A2A Exposure:** Write Python code to simulate exposing the `ReviewerAgent` as a remote service using the A2A protocol (e.g., defining an endpoint or using ADK's `to_a2a()` helper, referencing the need for robust state management and tracing in production environments).\n",
        "    *   **`ScriptAgent`:** A delegating agent (simulating `backend/app/agents/script_agent.py`) that uses the exposed `ReviewerAgent` as a tool (via `RemoteA2aAgent` or `AgentTool`) to delegate the quality check task.\n",
        "3.  **Deployment Packaging Simulation:** Write Python code (using file system operations common in Colab/Kaggle) to **simulate creating the required file structure** for the `backend/` directory, including dummy or foundational versions of:\n",
        "    *   `requirements.txt` (listing dependencies like ADK).\n",
        "    *   `app/main.py` (the entry point).\n",
        "    *   `app/pipelines/tutoring_pipeline.py` (the main pipeline orchestrator).\n",
        "4.  **Deployment Command Generation:** Generate the required **ADK CLI command syntax** (`adk deploy`) necessary to package and deploy this simulated `backend/` directory to the **Vertex AI Agent Engine**, including placeholders for project ID and location.\n",
        "5.  **Post-Deployment Test Simulation:** Write Python code simulating the final step: interacting with the *deployed* agent via the Vertex AI SDK (`vertexai.agent_engines.run()`) to confirm the deployment is successful and the A2A chain is functional.\n",
        "6.  **Cleanup Command:** Include the necessary ADK CLI command syntax for deleting the deployed agent engine instance to manage costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generation Prompt\n",
        "\"Generate the runnable Python code for the '06_backend_api_prototyping.ipynb' notebook for the **TinyTutor** project. The solution must define a two-agent A2A system (`ScriptAgent` delegates to `ReviewerAgent`). Simulate the creation of the modular backend file structure required for production. Then, generate the explicit ADK CLI commands for deploying this structure to the Vertex AI Agent Engine and include Python code to simulate a successful post-deployment test query. Finally, provide the cleanup command.\""
