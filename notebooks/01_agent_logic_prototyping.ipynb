        "# TinyTutor Capstone Notebook 1: Agent Logic Prototyping (Text & Reasoning)\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "Generate runnable Python code using the **Google ADK** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** to define the foundational text-processing components for the **TinyTutor** educational system. This notebook must establish the core reasoning agents and implement a deterministic **Sequential Workflow** to prototype the \"Explain It Like I'm 5\" (ELI5) textual output, serving as the foundational Level 1 Connected Problem-Solver architecture.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Include standard imports (ADK Agents, Runners, Gemini Model), API key setup boilerplate, and model retry configuration (`retry_config`).\n",
        "2.  **Pedagogy Agent (`LlmAgent`):** Define the first agent, focusing solely on core reasoning.\n",
        "    *   **Role:** Acts as the ELI5 subject expert. It must simplify a complex topic to an age-appropriate level, ensuring the response adheres to educational constraints.\n",
        "    *   **Output Key:** Store its simplified explanation in the session state using `output_key=\"eli5_explanation\"`.\n",
        "3.  **Scriptwriting Agent (`LlmAgent`):** Define the second agent. This agent must demonstrate Context Engineering.\n",
        "    *   **Role:** Transforms the ELI5 explanation into a structured story script, complete with characters and child-friendly pacing.\n",
        "    *   **Input Consumption:** Its instruction prompt **MUST** explicitly consume the output of the `PedagogyAgent` using the `{eli5_explanation}` placeholder.\n",
        "    *   **Output Key:** Store the structured final script in the session state using `output_key=\"final_script\"`.\n",
        "4.  **Workflow Orchestration:** Create an ADK **`SequentialAgent`** named `TextPipeline`.\n",
        "    *   **Pattern:** This pipeline must strictly enforce the order: `PedagogyAgent` followed by `ScriptwritingAgent`. This deterministic flow guarantees the content is simplified before being converted into a story.\n",
        "5.  **Execution:** Instantiate an `InMemoryRunner` and execute a debug run to demonstrate the end-to-end reasoning flow and successful state passing for the topic \"Explain how Black Holes work like I am 5.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Generation Prompt\n",
        "\"Generate the runnable Python code for the '01_agent_logic_prototyping.ipynb' notebook for the **TinyTutor** project. The code must define and link the `PedagogyAgent` and `ScriptwritingAgent` via an ADK `SequentialAgent` pipeline named `TextPipeline`. Ensure the `ScriptwritingAgent` utilizes the output of the `PedagogyAgent` via session state placeholders (`output_key` mechanism). Demonstrate a successful execution for the topic 'Explain how Black Holes work like I am 5.' The solution must use `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` and follow the sequential architecture.\""
